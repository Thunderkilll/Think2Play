 <!-- game dots id : d -->
 <h1> Dots and Boxes Rules.</h1>
 <h2> Object of the board game.</h2>
 <p id ="d" style="color: white;"> Take more boxes than your opponent. You move by connecting two dots with a line.
  When you place the last ‘wall’ of a single square (box), the box is yours and the corresponding image appears inside the box. 
  The players move in turn, but whenever a player takes a box (s)he must move again. 
  The board game ends when all 36 boxes have been taken. The player with the most boxes wins.</p>
